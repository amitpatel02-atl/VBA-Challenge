# VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street

Wall street stocks are always changing, either the stock goes up or goes down.  

For this homework assignment  Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

  1. The ticker symbol.

  2. Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  3. The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  4. The total stock volume of the stock.

* You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* The result should look as follows.

### Other Considerations

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3-5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on each sheet. The joy of VBA is to take the tediousness out of repetitive task and run over and over
